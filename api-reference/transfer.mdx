# Transfers

Transfers enable organizations, businesses and customers move funds efficiently through various processes. This document provides an overview of key transfer operations, including account name enquiry, transaction status checks, business transfers, and organization-wide transactions.

## Name Enquiry

When a transfer is initiated, a session ID is generated. Before completing the transaction, it is important to validate the recipientâ€™s account details to ensure accuracy. The name enquiry process helps verify the provided account number and retrieve the name associated with it. This step prevents errors and ensures that funds are sent to the intended recipient.

## Check Transaction Status

After a transfer has been initiated, it is essential to confirm its status. This allows businesses to track whether a transaction has been successfully processed, is still pending, or has failed. The transaction status check provides clarity and helps businesses take necessary actions in case of delays or issues.
