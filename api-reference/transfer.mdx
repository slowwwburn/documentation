# Transfers

Transfers enable organizations, businesses and customers move funds efficiently through various processes. This document provides an overview of key transfer operations, including account name enquiry, transaction status checks, business transfers, and organization-wide transactions.

**Name Enquiry**

When sending an account name enquiry request, a 30-digit session ID must be provided. This session ID allows the platform to verify that the beneficiary of a transfer request has been previously validated by the sender. This process reduces the risk of funds being sent to the wrong recipient and mitigates failed transactions, ensuring a smoother transfer experience.

**Check Transaction Status**

After a transfer has been successfully initiated, it is essential for the organization to have real-time access to confirm its status. This enables tracking of the transaction throughout its processing lifecycle. The transaction status check provides clarity and helps individuals or businesses take necessary actions in case of delays or issues.
