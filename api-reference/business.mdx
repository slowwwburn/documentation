  		</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    	**Wallet Management:** Upon KYB validation, wallets are created for the respective business, enabling them to hold and move funds. Additionally, businesses can create and manage wallets for their customers, ensuring seamless financial transactions.
    </li>
    <li>
    	**Fund Transfers:** Businesses can transfer funds to and from their own wallets as well as facilitate transfers for their customers to valid NGN wallets.
    </li>

</ol>

## Prerequisites:

<ul>
	<li>
		Businesses must submit required documentation for verification and
		activation on the platform before they are able to onboard customers.
	</li>
	<li>
		Once verified and active, businesses receive a unique identifier and wallet
		access.
	</li>
</ul>

## Business Transfer

Business transfers involve initiating a single payout for a business entity. Since businesses operate under an organization, they must specify relevant transaction details, such as the amount, recipient information, and a reference for tracking. This ensures that businesses can efficiently manage payouts and maintain accurate financial records.
