Know Your Business (KYB) verification ensures that an organization meets compliance requirements before conducting financial transactions. This process involves submitting necessary details and documents to verify the legitimacy of the business.

## Create Customer Wallet

Organizations can create dedicated wallets for their customers to facilitate seamless financial transactions. A customer wallet allows users to store funds, make payments, and receive transfers within the organization's ecosystem.

Businesses operating under an organization often serve multiple customers. This process enables organizations to register customers, assign them unique identifiers, and manage their transactions within the business framework.

Organizations need visibility into their financial activities. This process allows them to retrieve a list of transactions performed under their structure, helping with reconciliation, auditing, and financial decision-making.

## Upload Organization Customer File

Organizations may need to upload bulk customer data or specific customer-related files for processing. This process ensures that customer records are properly documented and managed within the system.

## Organization Verify Director

To maintain compliance, organizations must verify the identity of their directors. This process involves submitting identification and business details to confirm the legitimacy of key personnel.
