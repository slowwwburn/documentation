## Overview

Webhooks allow your system to receive real-time updates from our platform. Instead of constantly checking (polling) for updates, we notify your system as soon as something happens — like a payment being made or a user completing a form.

It’s like getting a text message when a delivery arrives, instead of refreshing the tracking page every 5 minutes!

---

## How It Works

1. You give us a webhook URL (an API endpoint on your server).
2. We send a `POST` request to that URL when a payment is made.
3. You process the transaction data on your end — e.g., mark an order as paid.

Here is simple example of a webhook URL

```json
app.post('/your-url/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
    // Handle the event
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Sample Notification Payload

Whenever a wallet account receives a credit, your webhook endpoint will receive a JSON payload as seen to the right ->

#### Authenticating Webhook Notifications

All authentic webhook notifications will include the following HTTP headers:

```
	"svix-id": "msg_p5jXN8AQM9LWM0D4loKWxJek"
	"svix-timestamp": "1614265330"
	"svix-signature": "v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE="
```

To **validate a webhook notification**, follow these steps:

---

#### ✅ Validation Steps

1. **Extract the following values from the headers and request body:**

   - `svix-id`
   - `svix-timestamp`
   - `svix-signature`
   - Raw request body (unparsed string)

2. **Construct the signed payload** by concatenating: `=svix_id.svix_timestamp.body`

3. **Compute the HMAC-SHA256 hash** of the constructed payload using your **signing secret** as the key.

4. **Base64-encode** the resulting hash.

5. **Compare** the Base64-encoded hash with the signature in `svix-signature` (excluding the `v1,` prefix).
