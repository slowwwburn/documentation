### Organization Business

An Organization Business represents a distinct unit, outlet, or division that operates under a parent organization.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Scoped Wallet Management:</strong> Each Organization Business can create and manage multiple virtual wallets based on its operational needs. These wallets are independent from the parent organization’s wallets but remain under the organization’s overall structure. This allows for tailored financial flows, better tracking, and clear boundaries between units.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Custom Labels and Identification:</strong> Wallets created under an Organization Business can be assigned custom labels to match internal use cases (e.g., “Sales Wallet”, “Agent Payouts”). This ensures better organization, reporting, and clarity for finance and operations teams.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Freezing and Unfreezing Capabilities:</strong> An Organization Business entity can freeze or unfreeze a wallet when necessary—for example, in response to suspicious activity or internal audits. This adds a layer of financial control and security at every level.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Paginated Wallet Listing and Search:</strong> An Organization and Business can fetch a paginated list of all wallets created under a specific Organization Business. This supports efficient querying, filtering, and monitoring of wallets across multiple branches or business units.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Direct Wallet Access by ID:</strong>  Detailed information about any specific wallet can be retrieved under an Organization Business using the wallet ID. This enables integration with dashboards, reconciliation systems, or internal audit tools.
